# Redux Candy Shop

This is a simple e-commerce app that allows the users to add/delete items from cart, add/delete items from stock, checkout items, and populate items from an inventory database. This is an experiment in Redux Toolkit and various CSS styling. 

This project was fully adapted from Rob Hess's CS 499 Advanced Web Dev Course. I do not give permission nor consent to fabricate any of the code for academic misconduct as long as it is still in use at OSU. 

I did not complete this project as part of this class. Just found the guidelines <a href="https://github.com/kjiroux/AdvancedWebDevelopment/tree/ac6da4488c8216fce7445dcfc9af14467695291b/assignment-4-kjiroux">here</a> and decided to take a shot at it.
