This is a mock database based off data taken from the StarWars API that allows the user to search and populate data. This project implements React Router and various React Hooks. 

This project was fully adapted from Rob Hess's CS 499 Advanced Web Dev Course. I do not give permission nor consent to fabricate any of the code for academic misconduct as long as it is still in use at OSU. 

I did not complete this project as part of this class. Just found the guidelines <a href="https://github.com/MarkleyO/CS499-Advanced-Web-Development/tree/main/assignment-2-MarkleyO">here</a> and decided to take a shot at it. 

#### Deployment: https://react-projects-lac.vercel.app/
