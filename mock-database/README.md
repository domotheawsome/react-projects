# Photo Library

This is a simple photo library that allows the user to add and delete photos. This project manages state between parent and child components, insertion/deletion of a state array, and managing native React forms.

This project was fully adapted from Rob Hess's CS 499 Advanced Web Dev Course. I do not give permission nor consent to fabricate any of the code for academic misconduct as long as it is still in use at OSU. 

I did not complete this project as part of this class. Just found the guidelines <a href="https://github.com/MarkleyO/CS499-Advanced-Web-Development/tree/main/assignment-1-MarkleyO">here</a> and decided to take a shot at it. 

#### Deployment: https://react-projects-lac.vercel.app/
