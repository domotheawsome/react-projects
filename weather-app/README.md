This is a simple weather app which communicates with the Open Weather API and styled using Material UI and Emotion. This project allows the user to input queries for a specific city, fetches current data from the Open Weather API, and beautifully displays it onto the screen. I'm assuming you'll input a city in this format: "City,State,Country".

This project was fully adapted from Rob Hess's CS 499 Advanced Web Dev Course. I do not give permission nor consent to fabricate any of the code for academic misconduct as long as it is still in use at OSU. 

I did not complete this project as part of this class. Just found the guidelines <a href="https://github.com/MarkleyO/CS499-Advanced-Web-Development/tree/main/assignment-1-MarkleyO">here</a> and decided to take a shot at it.
